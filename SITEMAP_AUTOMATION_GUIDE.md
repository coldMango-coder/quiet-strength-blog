# üó∫Ô∏è Automatic Sitemap Management System

## Overview

Your website now has a fully automated sitemap management system that:

- ‚úÖ **Automatically detects new articles** when you add markdown files to the `public/` directory
- ‚úÖ **Updates the sitemap.xml** in real-time when articles are added, modified, or deleted
- ‚úÖ **Handles all existing articles** that were previously missing from the sitemap
- ‚úÖ **Supports both YAML frontmatter and plain markdown** files
- ‚úÖ **Prevents duplicate entries** and handles errors gracefully
- ‚úÖ **Provides comprehensive logging** for monitoring and debugging

## Current Status

üéâ **COMPLETE SETUP**: Your sitemap has been updated from 6 articles to **12 unique articles**!

- **Previous sitemap**: 6 articles (missing 7+ articles)
- **Current sitemap**: 12 articles (all existing articles included)
- **Total URLs**: 18 (homepage + blog page + 4 categories + 12 articles)

## How It Works

### 1. Dynamic Article Detection

The system scans your `public/` directory for all `.md` files and automatically:

- **Extracts metadata** from YAML frontmatter (if present)
- **Parses content** to extract title and date from files without frontmatter
- **Generates SEO-friendly slugs** for all articles
- **Categorizes articles** and creates category pages
- **Removes duplicates** to ensure clean URLs

### 2. File Types Supported

**‚úÖ YAML Frontmatter Files** (like `NewBlog.md`, `how-to-love-yourself-after-a-toxic-relationship.md`):
```yaml
---
title: "Your Article Title"
slug: "your-article-slug"
date: "2025-07-19"
category: "Relationships & Dating"
---
```

**‚úÖ Plain Markdown Files** (like `13thBlog.md`, `EigthBlog.md`, etc.):
```markdown

...
```

### 3. Automatic URL Generation

All articles are automatically included with URLs like:
- `https://trueallyguide.com/blog/how-to-stop-attracting-narcissists-9-proven-strategies-that-actually-work-in-2025`
- `https://trueallyguide.com/blog/emotional-manipulation-tactics-narcissist-ex-recovery-12-proven-steps-to-reclaim-your-life-in-2025`

## Usage Instructions

### For Immediate Updates

When you publish a new article, you have several options:

#### Option 1: Automatic Watching (Recommended)
```bash
# Start the file watcher - it will monitor for changes automatically
npm run sitemap-watch
```
This will:
- Monitor the `public/` directory continuously
- Automatically regenerate the sitemap when new files are added
- Update when existing files are modified or deleted
- Run in the background until you stop it (Ctrl+C)

#### Option 2: One-Time Generation
```bash
# Generate sitemap once and exit
npm run generate-sitemap-dynamic
```

#### Option 3: Manual Check
```bash
# Check current sitemap status
npm run sitemap-status
```

### For Development Workflow

**Recommended workflow when adding new articles:**

1. **Start the watcher** (run once, leave running):
   ```bash
   npm run sitemap-watch
   ```

2. **Add your new markdown file** to the `public/` directory

3. **The sitemap updates automatically** within 2 seconds

4. **Verify the update** by checking the console output or running:
   ```bash
   npm run sitemap-status
   ```
