# Development Environment Fix Log

## Issue
When running `npm start`, the browser was opening a different project's localhost page instead of the current "quiet-strength-blog" project.

## Root Cause Analysis
- **Framework**: Create React App (react-scripts)
- **Port Conflict**: Port 3000 was already occupied by another project (process ID: 18288)
- **Service Worker**: Project has an active service worker that could cause cross-project conflicts
- **Configuration**: No existing environment configuration to specify a different port

## Changes Made

### 1. Port Configuration (.env.local)
**File Created**: `.env.local`
```
PORT=3001
HOST=127.0.0.1
```
- **Rationale**: Port 3001 was available and is a common alternative to 3000
- **Host Setting**: Using 127.0.0.1 provides better isolation from other localhost services
- **Impact**: Reversible - delete file to revert to default port 3000

### 2. Service Worker Isolation (scripts/unregister-sw.js)
**File Created**: `scripts/unregister-sw.js`
- **Purpose**: Provides script to clear service worker registrations if cross-project conflicts occur
- **Usage**: Run the script content in browser dev console if needed
- **Impact**: Non-destructive - only creates utility script, doesn't modify application behavior

## Verification Results
- ✅ Development server starts successfully on port 3001
- ✅ HTTP response returns 200 status code
- ✅ Application accessible at http://127.0.0.1:3001
- ✅ No conflicts with the other project on port 3000
- ✅ Browser isolation achieved through different port and host binding

## Technical Details
- **Node.js**: v22.17.0
- **npm**: 10.9.2
- **Framework**: Create React App with react-scripts 5.0.1
- **Project Name**: quiet-strength-blog (from package.json)

## Commands to Use Going Forward
```bash
npm start
# Now opens at http://127.0.0.1:3001 instead of http://localhost:3000
```

## Rollback Instructions
To revert changes if needed:
1. Delete `.env.local` file
2. Delete `scripts/unregister-sw.js` file
3. Clear browser cache for both localhost:3000 and 127.0.0.1:3001

## Additional Notes
- All changes are scoped to development configuration only
- No application features, UI, or business logic were modified
- Changes are completely reversible
- Service worker remains functional but isolated to the correct project
