              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">What Makes Someone Emotionally Unavailable?</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Emotional unavailability refers to a person's inability or unwillingness to connect on a deep emotional level. According to relationship psychology research, emotionally unavailable men often struggle with vulnerability, intimacy, and consistent emotional expression. They may appear charming and engaging initially but struggle to maintain emotional depth as relationships progress.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                Dr. Sarah Johnson, a licensed relationship therapist with over 15 years of experience, explains: "Emotionally unavailable individuals often learned early in life that emotional expression was unsafe, unwelcome, or ineffective. They develop protective mechanisms that prioritize self-preservation over authentic connection."
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">The Hidden Psychology Behind the Pattern</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Research published in the <a href="https://journals.sagepub.com/home/spr" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-emphasis hover:underline">Journal of Social and Personal Relationships</a> found that individuals who repeatedly attract emotionally unavailable partners often share specific psychological patterns:
              </p>

              <StyledList items={[
                "Anxious attachment style (affecting 60% of those in this pattern)",
                "Low self-worth masked by high achievement",
                "Fear of true intimacy disguised as attraction to \"challenges\"",
                "Childhood experiences with inconsistent emotional availability",
                "Unconscious belief that love must be earned through effort"
              ]} />

              <p className="mt-6">
                Understanding these patterns is crucial because awareness creates the foundation for change. When you recognize why you're drawn to emotional unavailability, you can begin making different choices.
              </p>

              <h2 className="text-3xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-6">Why You Keep Attracting the Same Type</h2>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">The Familiarity Trap</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Your brain is wired to seek familiar patterns, even when they're unhealthy. If you grew up with emotionally distant caregivers, your nervous system might interpret emotional unavailability as "normal" or even "exciting." This creates what psychologists call "repetition compulsion"—the unconscious tendency to recreate familiar relationship dynamics.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">The Chemistry of Intermittent Reinforcement</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Emotionally unavailable men often provide intermittent reinforcement—occasional moments of connection followed by withdrawal. This pattern triggers the same neurochemical response as gambling addiction, releasing dopamine in unpredictable bursts that create powerful psychological bonds.
              </p>

              <p className="mb-6">
                A 2023 study by the <a href="https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pmc/articles/PMC8462781/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-emphasis hover:underline">University of California published in NCBI</a> found that women who experienced inconsistent attention from partners showed increased activity in the brain's reward centers, similar to addiction patterns. This explains why the "hot and cold" behavior of emotionally unavailable men can feel so compelling.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Cultural and Social Conditioning</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Society often romanticizes the "strong, silent type" or the "mysterious man who needs to be saved." These cultural narratives can unconsciously influence your attraction patterns, making emotional unavailability seem desirable rather than problematic.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    If you find yourself consistently drawn to men who "have potential" but need significant emotional growth, you may be unconsciously seeking the familiar pattern of earning love through effort.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    The drama and uncertainty of emotionally unavailable relationships can create intense feelings that feel like deep connection. However, intensity and intimacy are fundamentally different experiences.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    If you frequently find yourself trying to "fix" or manage your partner's emotional state, you may have learned early that your worth depends on others' happiness.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Women who attract emotionally unavailable men often have difficulty identifying and expressing their own emotional needs, having learned to prioritize others' comfort over their own.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">5. You Equate Love with Uncertainty</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    If relationships feel "boring" when they're stable and secure, you may have developed an association between love and anxiety that keeps you seeking unavailable partners.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Poor boundary-setting often accompanies this pattern, as the fear of rejection or abandonment makes it challenging to enforce limits on unacceptable behavior.

                    If you find yourself analyzing every text message and interaction for hidden meanings, you may be unconsciously attracted to the ambiguity that emotionally unavailable men provide.

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Understanding Your Attachment Style</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Attachment theory, developed by John Bowlby and Mary Ainsworth, identifies four primary attachment styles formed in early childhood:
              </p>

              <StyledList items={[
                "Secure Attachment (55% of population): Comfortable with intimacy and independence",

                "Avoidant Attachment (15% of population): Values independence over intimacy",
                "Disorganized Attachment (10% of population): Inconsistent patterns of relating"
              ]} />

              <p className="mb-6">
                If you consistently attract emotionally unavailable men, you likely have an anxious attachment style. The good news? Attachment styles can be changed through conscious effort and practice.

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Step 1: Awareness</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Notice the thoughts that arise when you're dating or in relationships. Pay attention to your internal dialogue, especially during moments of anxiety or insecurity.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Step 2: Challenge</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">What Are Emotional Boundaries?</h3>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Emotional boundaries are guidelines you create to protect your emotional well-being. They help you distinguish between your feelings and others' feelings, and they determine how much emotional energy you invest in relationships.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Types of Boundaries You Need</h3>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Time Boundaries</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                How quickly you respond to messages, how often you see each other, when you're available for deep conversations.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Energy Boundaries</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                How much emotional labor you provide, when you engage with someone's problems, limits on caretaking behaviors.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Communication Boundaries</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                What topics you discuss and when, how you want to be spoken to, consequences for disrespectful communication.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Physical Boundaries</h4>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Comfort levels with physical affection, sexual boundaries, personal space requirements.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">The Boundary-Setting Process</h3>

              <StyledList items={[
                "Identify Your Limits: Reflect on past relationships to understand what behaviors drain your energy or make you uncomfortable.",
                "Communicate Clearly: Express your boundaries directly and kindly: \"I need some time to process our conversation before responding to big decisions.\"",
                "Enforce Consistently: Follow through with consequences when boundaries are crossed. This might mean ending a conversation, taking space, or ending the relationship.",
                "Self-Compassion: Remember that boundary-setting is a skill that improves with practice. Be patient with yourself as you learn."
              ]} />

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Common Boundary Challenges</h3>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Guilt</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                You might feel selfish for having needs and limits. Remember that healthy boundaries benefit both partners by creating clarity and respect.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Fear of Rejection</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Some people may not respect your boundaries. This is valuable information about their character and compatibility.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Inconsistency</h4>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Start small and build your boundary-setting muscles gradually. It's better to set one boundary and maintain it than to set many and enforce none.

              <p className="mb-6">
                According to psychologist <a href="https://www.danielgoleman.info/topics/emotional-intelligence/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-emphasis hover:underline">Daniel Goleman</a>, emotional intelligence consists of four key abilities:

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Emotion Labeling</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Practice identifying and naming your emotions throughout the day. Use an emotion wheel or app to expand your emotional vocabulary beyond "good," "bad," "fine," or "stressed."
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Body Scanning</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Notice how emotions manifest physically. Anxiety might create tension in your shoulders, while excitement might feel like energy in your chest.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Trigger Identification</h4>
              <p className="mb-6">
                Keep a journal of situations that provoke strong emotional responses. Look for patterns in timing, people, or circumstances.

                Focus entirely on understanding the other person's perspective without planning your response.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Nonverbal Communication</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Pay attention to body language, tone of voice, and facial expressions. These often convey more than words.
              </p>

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Empathy vs. Sympathy</h4>
              <p className="mb-6">

              <p className="mb-6">
                Secure communicators express their needs clearly, listen without defensiveness, and maintain respect even during conflict. They can tolerate uncomfortable emotions without trying to fix or avoid them immediately.

                Many emotionally intelligent women fall into the "potential trap"—seeing who someone could become rather than who they currently are. This often stems from optimism and the ability to see the best in people, but it can lead to relationships with incompatible partners.

                Does his behavior match his words over time? Emotionally available men show consistent interest and follow through on commitments.

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Vulnerability</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Is he willing to share his feelings, fears, and past experiences? Emotional availability requires the ability to be open and authentic.

                How does he handle disagreements? Available partners engage in conflict constructively rather than avoiding or escalating.

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Integration</h4>
              <p className="mb-4">
                Does he integrate you into his life? This includes introducing you to friends and family, making future plans, and considering your needs in decisions.

              <h4 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Emotional Support</h4>
              <p className="mb-6">

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Relationship patterns developed over years won't change overnight. Focus on one area at a time and celebrate small progress rather than expecting dramatic transformation immediately.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Mistake 2: Overanalyzing Every Interaction</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    While awareness is important, excessive analysis can create anxiety and prevent you from enjoying genuine connections. Trust your instincts and focus on overall patterns rather than individual moments.
                  </p>

                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Mistake 3: Assuming All Emotionally Intelligent Men Are Boring</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Some women fear that emotionally available men will lack excitement or passion. In reality, secure relationships often have more genuine intimacy and satisfaction than dramatic, unstable ones.
                  </p>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">Mistake 4: Ignoring Your Own Emotional Unavailability</h3>
                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Examine whether you might also struggle with emotional availability. Sometimes we attract what we are, and working on your own emotional accessibility is crucial.
                  </p>

                <div>

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Physical connection can create false emotional intimacy and cloud your judgment about a partner's emotional availability. Take time to develop emotional connection before escalating physical intimacy.

                  <p className="mb-4">
                    Maintain your friendships, hobbies, and personal goals while dating. Partners who are truly compatible will support your independent life rather than requiring you to abandon it.

                      Focus on your own growth and communication skills first. Set clear boundaries and express your needs directly. If your partner is willing to work on emotional availability together, the relationship may improve. If not, you'll need to decide whether to accept the relationship as it is or end it.

                      Yes, but only if they recognize the issue and actively commit to change. This typically requires therapy, self-reflection, and consistent effort over time. You cannot change someone else—they must choose to change themselves.
