Unlike single-incident trauma, complex trauma develops from prolonged exposure to controlling, manipulative, or abusive behavior.

              <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark mb-4">Common psychological effects include:</p>

However, the brain's neuroplasticity means these changes aren't permanent. With intentional effort and the right strategies, you can literally rewire your brain to support self-love and healthy relationships.

                Learning how to love yourself after a toxic relationship isn't just about feeling betterâ€”it's about breaking the cycle that may have led you into the toxic relationship in the first place. Self-love acts as your internal compass, helping you recognize red flags, maintain boundaries, and make choices that honor your worth.

Remember that toxic behavior is about the perpetrator's issues, not your shortcomings. You cannot love someone into treating you well, and staying in a toxic relationship doesn't make you weakâ€”it makes you human.
