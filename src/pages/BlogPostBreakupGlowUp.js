              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">What is a Post-Breakup Glow Up?</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark mb-6">
                A post-breakup glow up is a comprehensive transformation that encompasses your physical appearance, mental health, emotional well-being, career prospects, and overall life satisfaction. Unlike revenge transformations motivated by spite, a genuine glow up focuses on becoming your authentic best self for your own happiness and growth.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark mb-6">
                Studies from the <a href="https://www.frontiersin.org/articles/10.3389/fpsyg.2020.590748/full" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer" className="text-brand-emphasis hover:underline">University of California, Berkeley</a>, found that individuals who approached post-breakup periods as opportunities for self-discovery showed 40% greater resilience and life satisfaction compared to those who remained focused on their ex-partners.
              </p>

              <h3 className="text-2xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-4">The Science Behind Transformation</h3>
              <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark mb-6">
                When you go through a breakup, your brain experiences a phenomenon called "neuroplasticity acceleration." This means your neural pathways are more adaptable to change, making it an optimal time for developing new habits, skills, and perspectives. Research on heartbreak shows that the brain treats emotional pain similarly to physical pain, but this same intensity can fuel remarkable personal growth when channeled correctly.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark mb-6">
                Before any external transformation can stick, you need to address your emotional foundation. This isn't about "getting over it" quickly—it's about processing your feelings in a way that empowers your growth.
              </p>

              <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark mb-6">

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">How long does a post-breakup glow up take?</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark">
                    Most people see significant changes within 90 days, but lasting transformation is an ongoing process. Physical changes may be noticeable within 4-6 weeks, while emotional and lifestyle changes often take 3-6 months to fully integrate.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Can I start my transformation immediately after a breakup?</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark">
                    Yes, but be gentle with yourself. Start with basic self-care and emotional processing before adding more intensive changes. Your transformation should support your healing, not distract from it.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">What if I don't have money for a major makeover?</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark">
                    The most impactful changes don't require significant financial investment. Focus on free activities like exercise, meditation, library books, and spending time in nature. Many transformation elements cost more time and consistency than money.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">How do I know if I'm ready to date again?</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark">
                    You're likely ready when you feel genuinely happy with your life and yourself, rather than looking for someone to complete you. You should be dating because you want to share your full life with someone, not because you need them to feel whole.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">What if my friends don't support my changes?</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark">
                    Sometimes growth means outgrowing certain relationships. True friends will support your positive changes, even if they don't understand them. You may need to expand your social circle to include people who celebrate your growth.
                  </p>
                </div>

                <div>
                  <h3 className="text-xl font-bold text-brand-dark mb-3">Should I tell my ex about my transformation?</h3>
                  <p className="text-lg text-brand-dark">
                    Focus on your transformation for yourself, not to impress or get back at your ex. Sharing your progress with an ex-partner often complicates your healing process and can undermine your genuine motivation for change.
