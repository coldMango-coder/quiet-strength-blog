# Blog Creation Guide

This comprehensive guide explains how to create, manage, and publish new blog posts using the automated system.

## 📋 Quick Start

1. **Fill out the blog template**: Use `templates/blog-post-template.md`
2. **Run the creation script**: Generate the blog post with proper structure
3. **Update the sitemap**: Automatically includes the new post
4. **Test locally**: Verify everything works
5. **Deploy**: Push your changes

## 🚀 Step-by-Step Process

### Step 1: Prepare Your Content

1. **Copy the template**:
   ```bash
   cp templates/blog-post-template.md templates/my-new-blog.md
   ```

2. **Fill out the blog information**:
   - **Title**: Make it compelling and SEO-friendly
   - **Category**: Choose from the 5 available categories
   - **Description**: Write a 150-160 character meta description
   - **Keywords**: Include 5-10 relevant SEO keywords
   - **Image**: Add path to your featured image

3. **Write your content**: Use Markdown formatting for rich content

### Step 2: Generate the Blog Post

Use the automated script to create your blog post:

```bash
node scripts/create-blog-post.js \
  --title "Your Compelling Blog Title" \
  --category "Self-Development" \
  --description "Your SEO-optimized meta description" \
  --file templates/my-new-blog.md \
  --keywords "keyword1,keyword2,keyword3,keyword4,keyword5" \
  --image "/images/your-featured-image.jpg"
```

### Step 3: Update the Sitemap

The script automatically updates the sitemap, but you can also regenerate it manually:

```bash
# Generate sitemap from all existing markdown files
node scripts/generate-sitemap-dynamic.js

# Validate the sitemap
node scripts/generate-sitemap-dynamic.js --validate
```

### Step 4: Test Your Blog Post

1. **Start the development server**:
   ```bash
   npm start
   ```

2. **Visit your blog post**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/blog/your-blog-slug
   ```

3. **Check the blog listing**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/blog
   ```

4. **Verify the sitemap**:
   ```
   http://localhost:3000/sitemap.xml
   ```

### Step 5: Deploy

Once everything looks good, deploy your changes according to your hosting setup.

## 🛠️ Advanced Usage

### Creating Blog Posts from Multiple Files

If you have content split across multiple files:

```bash
# Combine content from multiple sources
cat intro.md main-content.md conclusion.md > complete-blog.md

# Then create the blog post
node scripts/create-blog-post.js \
  --title "Your Title" \
  --category "Self-Development" \
  --description "Your description" \
  --file complete-blog.md \
  --keywords "keyword1,keyword2"
```

### Bulk Operations

Generate sitemaps for multiple environments:

```bash
# Production
node scripts/generate-sitemap-dynamic.js

# Staging (if you have different base URLs)
BASE_URL=https://staging.trueallyguide.com node scripts/generate-sitemap-dynamic.js
```

### Custom Images

Optimize images for web:
- **Format**: Use WebP when possible, fallback to JPEG
- **Size**: Optimize for web (typically under 100KB)
- **Dimensions**: 1200x630px for social sharing
- **Alt text**: Include descriptive alt text for accessibility

## 🔧 Troubleshooting

### Common Issues

**"Module not found" error**:
```bash
# Make sure you're in the project root
cd Project_WEB_01

# Install dependencies if needed
npm install
```

**"Sitemap not updating"**:
```bash
# Regenerate the sitemap manually
node scripts/generate-sitemap-dynamic.js

# Check if the file was created
ls -la public/sitemap.xml
```

**"Blog post not showing up"**:
1. Check that the markdown file was created in `public/`
2. Verify the YAML frontmatter is properly formatted
3. Make sure the slug doesn't conflict with existing posts
4. Restart your development server

**"Invalid YAML frontmatter"**:
- Ensure all values are properly quoted
- Check for special characters that need escaping
- Validate YAML syntax online if needed

### Validation Commands

```bash
# Validate sitemap
node scripts/generate-sitemap-dynamic.js --validate

# Check blog post format
node -e "console.log(require('./scripts/create-blog-post.js'))"

# Test YAML parsing
node -e "
const fs = require('fs');
const content = fs.readFileSync('public/your-blog-slug.md', 'utf8');
console.log('YAML frontmatter detected:', content.startsWith('---'));
"
```
